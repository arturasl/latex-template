UUSSEESS
       The most common use of latexpand is to simplify distribution of source
       LaTeX files, typically to satisfy the requirement of editors and
       archival sites (springer, arXiv.org, ...) who force the authors to
       submit sources. One does not necessarily want to submit sources with
       comments, and uploading a document made of several files including each
       other is a bit painful. By default, latexpand answers both problems by
       outputing a single LaTeX file that contain no comment.
